## Overview
A set of premade minimap themes to make your map look fresh. Made for FST Enhanced Minimap, but works with other minimap scripts too. Includes Cayo Perico, Bridges, and Roxwood packs.
## Usage
Add the assets to any compatible minimap streaming setup. No install guide included (kept intentionally minimal).
